# SPA-useId

## Exercise Task: Using `useId`

In this exercise, you are to use the `useId` hook in a React component to assign a unique ID to an input field and a button and create a link between the two.

### Step-by-step instructions

1. create a new React component called `ContactForm`.
2. import the `useId` hook from `react`.
3. use the `useId` hook to create a unique ID for the input field.
   Use the `useId` hook again to create a unique ID for the button. 5.
   Create an `input` element and assign it the ID of the input field. 6.
4. create a `button` element and assign it the ID of the button.
   Add an `onClick` handler to the button that outputs the value of the input field to the console.
5. render the `ContactForm` component in another component or in the `index.js` file.

### Bonus task

Extend the `ContactForm` component to add more fields like name, email and message and use `useId` to create unique IDs for all fields. Also use the `label` element to create a link between the fields and their labels.
